# Glumboi-Debug
A small DLL I created to help debugging winforms projects, It's not complete yet.
Currently it only has a small console log that can be customized.

# How to use
To create a new instance of the debug console use this line 
      public static DebugConsole debugConsole = new DebugConsole(2, "EZPCBSCheats Debug Console", true /*ConfigVars.GetDebugMode()*/, true);
